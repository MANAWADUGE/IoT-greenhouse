# IoT-greenhouse
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT project that collects soil data using sensors. The project is designed to measure various parameters of the soil, including moisture levels, temperature, and pH. The collected data is then transmitted wirelessly to a cloud-based platform for further analysis.
